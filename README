# rpi-pcspeaker by jsubirat
#
# Enables the user to reproduce musical notes with a Raspberry Pi and a classical PC speaker, depending on the introduced key.
# 
# Connections:
#       * Speaker + - GPIO 23 (can be modified in SPEAKERPORT variable)
#       * Speaker - - GND
#
# The polarity doesn't matter as long as it is a classical PC speaker. Note that GPIO v0.5.2a is required to have software-PWM.
